### How can mindless mathematical laws give rise to aims and intention?

0. WTF are you even talking about? 3
1. Rambling free-writing about relevant ideas without a firm thesis: 3
2. Conclusion of "it's impossible" or other worthless cop-out. Seriously, aims, intentions, goals, cause and effects, and reality fucking exist. If you don't think: 2
3. An honest-to-god unambiguous falsifiable hypothesis: 0

## [To what extent can we influence our future?](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2827)

Didn't finish reading. Nothing I read or skimmed was relevant to the theme question. The author droned on about what he wanted to write about without addressing the proper topic.

relevance: 0/3
interesting: 2/7

## [The Wheels of Will: On the False Question of the Origin of Purpose](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2828)

Very intelligent, well-written, though-provoking, and wrong. The existence of mind and will cannot be impossible. We know this because **brains exist** and any aspect of the mind can be removed by damage to specific and consistent areas. The mind must be a physical processes like flight or photosynthesis.

relevance: 2/3
interesting: 5/7 - would be higher but the thesis of "it can't be answered" was a cop-out

## [My Dog and the World Formula](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2834)

This is a few rambling ideas thrown together with little relevance to the topic. At least it was short.

relevance: 1/3
interesting: 3/7

## [Mathematical laws, a necessity but not sufficient](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2850)

e.g. "The Language of Nature"

There are some interesting ideas here, but little focus. I am unclear what thesis is attempting to be supported. This reads like a first-draft free-writing with no conclusion.

relevance: 2/3
interesting: 4/7

## [The Drunken Walk Towards a Goal](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2854)

You sure think you are pretty awesome. I don't see it. Stop trying so hard to appear impressive and make a clear point. Still, a lot of interesting ideas in here. So you are saying sand dunes are conscious? I mean, they have electrons. You need to lay off the sauce man. It's like you can't tell the difference between and intelligent system and an inanimate object.

relevance: 1/3
interesting: 3/7 The conclusion methods for describing consciousness is "Right now, they're aren't any." Thanks for nothing.

## [The Hard Problem](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2853)

So you dismiss the question so you can talk about time instead? Reality is an illusion? Hogwash. QM is not consciousness, but if it was no compelling evidence was used to support that idea. Arguing the cause-and-effect doesn't exist is not constructive.

relevance: 1/3
interesting: 3/7

## [Is goal-oriented behavior a physical or cosmic trend, an accident or an imperative?](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2852)

Saying the universe has no goal is not answering the question. We aren't talking about an anthropomorphic universe. People have goals. Explain that. This was just a lot of religious references.

relevance: 0/3
interesting: 2/7

## [Wandering Towards a Goal or Wandering for a Chance or No Wandering?](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2851)

Stop talking about the big bang - that isn't what this question is about!

relevance: 0

## [How can mindless mathematical laws give rise to aims and intention](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2849)

Wow, right out of the gate with "it's impossible." so disappointing. "The World is not real" is not what the topic is about. Shut the fuck up you time-wasting son of a bitch.

## [SUBSTITUTING MATHEMATICS FOR NATURE](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2848)

The author is missionary of the religion of inherent meaning in math. I don't think he made any relevant points, but I did enjoy reading.

relevance: 1/3
interest: 4/7

## [The Tablet of the Metalaw](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2847)

OMG finally an essay that addresses the topic! Though it was long after a lot of irrelevant stuff about math. Unfortunately the author does not draw a clear conclusion.

relevance: 2/3
interest: 5/7

## [Long term stability and the meaning of life](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2846)

Holy shit! I can't believe an author actually trying to answer the question! And in a biological context. A marvelous collection of information about the origins of life on earth, but of questionable relevance to the topic.

relevance: 2/3
interest: 5/7
