### How can mindless mathematical laws give rise to aims and intention?

0. WTF are you even talking about? 3
1. Rambling free-writing about relevant ideas without a firm thesis: 3
2. Conclusion of "it's impossible" or other worthless cop-out. Seriously, aims, intentions, goals, cause and effects, and reality fucking exist. If you don't think: 2
3. An honest-to-god unambiguous falsifiable hypothesis: 0

<!-- ## [To what extent can we influence our future?](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2827)

Didn't finish reading. Nothing I read or skimmed was relevant to the theme question. The author droned on about what he wanted to write about without addressing the proper topic.

## [The Wheels of Will: On the False Question of the Origin of Purpose](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2828)

<!-- Very intelligent, well-written, though-provoking, and wrong. The existence of mind and will cannot be impossible. We know this because **brains exist** and any aspect of the mind can be removed by damage to specific and consistent areas. The mind must be a physical processes like flight or photosynthesis.

I thoroughly enjoyed your essay; it is one of my favorites so far. You are one of a very few that have articulated and supported your thesis to be rigorous enough to be falsifiable. So please know it is with respect that I believe your belief that conscious phenomena like mind and will cannot exist. [b]Brains exists.[/b] Without this complex mechanism in our skulls, [i]will[/i] has never been observed. Furthermore, no aspect of the mind, including will, has been consistently shown to not be removable as a result of specific brain damage. This should lead us to believe that will, consciousness, and other properties of the mind are biological processes not significantly different than flight or photosynthesis.

relevance: 2/3
interesting: 5/7 - would be higher but the thesis of "it can't be answered" was a cop-out -->

<!-- ## [My Dog and the World Formula](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2834)

This is a few rambling ideas thrown together with little relevance to the topic. At least it was short.

relevance: 1/3

<!-- ## [Mathematical laws, a necessity but not sufficient](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2850)

e.g. "The Language of Nature"

There are some interesting ideas here, but little focus. I am unclear what thesis is attempting to be supported. This reads like a first-draft free-writing with no conclusion.

interesting: 4/7 -->

<!-- ## [The Drunken Walk Towards a Goal](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2854)

You sure think you are pretty awesome. I don't see it. Stop trying so hard to appear impressive and make a clear point. Still, a lot of interesting ideas in here. So you are saying sand dunes are conscious? I mean, they have electrons. You need to lay off the sauce man. It's like you can't tell the difference between and intelligent system and an inanimate object.

relevance: 1/3
interesting: 3/7 The conclusion methods for describing consciousness is "Right now, they're aren't any." Thanks for nothing. -->

<!-- ## [The Hard Problem](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2853)

So you dismiss the question so you can talk about time instead? Reality is an illusion? Hogwash. QM is not consciousness, but if it was no compelling evidence was used to support that idea. Arguing the cause-and-effect doesn't exist is not constructive.

relevance: 1/3
interesting: 3/7 -->

This seems to share a common logical flaw of many of these essays where broad concepts such as [i]will[/i] and [i]purpose[/i] are dismissed without the consideration of breaking them down into smaller concepts. There is no reason to assume that [i]will[/i] at the micro, macro, mesoscopic scale are exactly the same phenomena.

<!--## [Is goal-oriented behavior a physical or cosmic trend, an accident or an imperative?](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2852)

relevance: 0/3
interesting: 2/7

Saying the universe has no goal is not answering the question. We aren't talking about an anthropomorphic universe. People have goals. Explain that. This was just a lot of religious references. -->

<!-- ## [Wandering Towards a Goal or Wandering for a Chance or No Wandering?](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2851)

Stop talking about the big bang - that isn't what this question is about!

<!-- ## [How can mindless mathematical laws give rise to aims and intention](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2849)

Wow, right out of the gate with "it's impossible." so disappointing. "The World is not real" is not what the topic is about. Shut the fuck up you time-wasting son of a bitch.

<!-- ## [SUBSTITUTING MATHEMATICS FOR NATURE](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2848)

The author is missionary of the religion of inherent meaning in math. I don't think he made any relevant points, but I did enjoy reading.

<!-- ## [The Tablet of the Metalaw](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2847)

OMG finally an essay that addresses the topic! Though it was long after a lot of irrelevant stuff about math. Unfortunately the author does not draw a clear conclusion.

<!-- ## [Long term stability and the meaning of life](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2846)

Holy shit! I can't believe an author actually trying to answer the question! And in a biological context. A marvelous collection of information about the origins of life on earth, but of questionable relevance to the topic.

<!-- ## [The Purpose of Scientific Realism by Munrid Qaraq](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2845)

This is a tepid discussion of scientific realism.

<!--## [Wandering Nonlinearly towards a Different Unification](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2844)

Interesting discussion of Bell's theorem in a nonlinear classical mechanical system. I don't see what this has to do with the topic.

<!--## [A Short Conversation on Wandering Toward a Goal](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2843)

This contained a small amount of socratic discussion on the topic, but was at least short and gave me a smile.

<!-- ## [The How and The Why of Emergence and Intention](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2840)

relevance: 2/3 - sorry but "it can't be answered cost you a point.
interest: 6/7 -->

<!-- This is the best essay I have read so far. Finally something articulate and relevant enough for me to argue against! I think you are wrong, but I hope you know it is with the highest respect.

Dude, you had me so hard until you said "The problem is undecidable." I am so disappointed. You are conflating "it is impossible to know with %100 certainty" with "it is impossible to know anything" Surely there are qualities of systems that imply the likelihood of intelligent design versus random occurrence. By letting the perfect obstruct the good, you are not allowing the discussion of those features to happen. It's like you are saying "If we can only be 99.99999% certain, then why bother?" In the same way, we can describe how intelligent creatures behave, then compare these characteristics to objects of indeterminate intelligence. Under your conclusion, we should not be able to tell the difference between an ape and a rock. This defies common sense.

There may not be one single type of intentionality. It is no unreasonable to believe that the type of intentionality that creates a galaxy is a separate process from the type that conscious being experience.-->

<!--## [SPACE: WHERE IT ALL BEGINS](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2839)

This a restatement of his doctoral thesis with dubious relation to the question. It is about spheres and tetrahedrons or something. I couldn't gather what his point was. At least the conclusion mentions the topic a little.

<!--## [Rethinking the Universe](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2838)

Humans are "semi-autonomous"? This was interesting, but hardly related to the topic.

## [The autocatalysis of meaning: or how intentions may fit within physics](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2855)

<!-- Damn, this guy gets down the purpose and meaning encoded in DNA. Well done. It was somewhat gratifying to finally find an essay that is somewhat congruent with my own, though Rene took a very different tack than I.

<!--# [Math Laws and Observer Wandering](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2699)

relevance: 2/3
interest: 4/7

Unclear what the point was. Maybe because I can't brain? Anyhow it was pleasant to read and on-topic, so you get a 6! -->

<!-- ## [Meaning and Intentionality = Information + Evolution](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2700)

relevance: 2/3 - "meaning" is not the same as "intention"
interest: 5/7 - "this could be shorter and easier to understand" -->

Um, physics is replete with concepts for emergent properties: entropy, rigid body motion, regression to the mean" are "forces" as humans think, but are emergent properties of the accumulation of many individual effects.

There are some errors when biological examples are given. "Thermodynamic equilibrium" is not the singular purpose of a living thing: self-replication is. Creating structures is merely a tool to accomplish its primary goal. Meaningful information could apply to any goal - gathering data, making paperclips, not just self-replication or resisting thermodynamic equilibrium. (though having structure is a requirement for any goal I can imagine, it still does not have to be the true, primary goal.)

Is this more about information/truth/meaning than goal/purpose/aim/intention?

Is physics actually fundamental, or could it result from emergent properties of as yet unknown underlying principals? It would be natural to always describe phenomena at the limit of our perception as fundamental, but how can we discern the difference between true fundamental, beneath which there is no underlying structure with simply the limits of our measurement instruments? Maybe that's too much but my point is that emergent properties are just as real as ones considered to be fundamental, despite what physicists want to think. There is not adequate evidence to reasonably assume that scale is inversely proportional to "fundamentalness".

## [The Dot, the Point, the Dot — the Intention](http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/2899)

This sort of metaphysics is like reading Chinese to me. Was there a point? I can't say yes or no for certain. I think I have to pass on this one.
