Though all constructed things display instinctual desire inherent in the form of their physical design and behavior, they don't necessarily share the feelings of desire of their creator. For a machine to internalize the intent to accomplish a goal, it must have an process of emotional desire. The simplest system has two requirements: 1) Options to randomly explore possible behaviors, and 2) Subjective sensors to indicate if the consequences of actions are beneficial or harmful to the eventual success of its primary goal. Foresight can be added to this simple system by associating objective situations to previously experienced subjective senses.
