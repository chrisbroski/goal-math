<h1>Subjective Senses</h1>

<p>Sensors <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are objective. They measure properties of the environment, but don't judge if that information is good or bad. We need to give our creation a different type of sensor - one that only indicates if actions are beneficial or harmful (increase or decrease the probability of accomplishing their primary goal.) These <em>subjective sensors</em> should have a value between 1.0 and -1.0 correlating to these meanings.

<ul>
<li><strong>1.0</strong> is the best possible outcome. It should indicate that the creature's primary goal has been achieved and if it never accomplishes anything else, it can die happy.
<li><strong>0.0</strong> indicates no affect on the chances of eventually accomplishing the primary goal.
<li><strong>-1.0</strong> is the worst thing that could possibly happen: death and dismemberment, all previous accomplishments destroyed and other terrible disasters.
</ul>

<p>Let's have action <em>P</em> return a subjective sense value equal to -0.001 minus its action parameter times 0.002. Moving costs time and energy and results in no immediate benefit. Our creature can't feel the simple joy of taking a walk, yet.

<p>Action <em>G</em> will return its action parameter value multiplied by -0.01, but when the parameter is greater than or equal to 3.0 (and a resource is close by) it adds 0.050, resulting in a net pleasurable response. Acquiring resources expends a little time and energy, but when successful, results in usable energy and other critical materials.
