# FQXi ESSAY CONTEST

# Wandering Towards a Goal

## How can mindless mathematical laws give rise to aims and intention?

### Relevance
<!--- How did physical systems that pursue the goal of reproduction arise from an a-biological world? -->
- What general features — like information processing, computation, learning, complexity thresholds, and/or departures from equilibrium — allow (or proscribe) agency?
<!-- - How are goals (versus accomplishments) linked to “arrows of time”?-->
- What separates systems that are intelligent from those that are not? Can we measure this separation objectively and without requiring reference to humans?
<!-- - What is the relationship between causality – the explanation of events in terms of causes – and teleology – the explanation of events in terms of purposes?
- Is goal-oriented behavior a physical or cosmic trend, an accident or an imperative? -->

### Interesting
- Original and Creative: Foremost, the intellectual content of the essay must push forward understanding of the topic in a fresh way or with new perspective. While the essay may or may not constitute original research, if the core ideas are largely contained in published works, those works should be the author's. At the same time, the entry should differ substantially from any previously published piece by the author.
- Technically correct and rigorously argued, to the degree of a published work or grant proposal.
- Well and clearly written, so that it is comprehensible and enjoyable to read.
- Accessible to a diverse, well-educated but non-specialist audience, aiming in the range between the level of Scientific American and a review article in Science or Nature.
